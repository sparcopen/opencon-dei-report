                <h2>Regional Diversity of Speakers</h2>

                <p>We recognize that the diversity of a meeting is reflected not only in the participant pool, but through invited speakers and presenters—those who often have the highest visibility during a meeting. People are working to advance Open Access, Open Data, and Open Education in a large variety of contexts and cultures, and it is important that our program reflects that, though we recognize OpenCon can still improve significantly in this respect.<br></br></p>

                <h4>Regional Diversity of Speakers (2014)</h4>
                <img src="Speaker Graphics_2014 Region.png" alt="Speaker Regional Demographics 2014" width=70%>

                <p>Since 2014, a component of OpenCon has included lightning talks called “project presentations” where participants give 3-minute talks on a project or project idea. The first two years we allocated these based on an open call, which led to significant overrepresentation of speakers from Western countries. For instance, in 2015, project presenters were almost entirely Northern American or European; there were only 2 presenters from Latin America/the Caribbean, and no presenters from Asia, Africa, or Oceania (see figure below).<br></br></p>

                <h4>Regional Diversity of Speakers (2015)</h4>
                <img src="Speaker Graphics_2015 Region.png" alt="Speaker Regional Demographics 2015" width=70%>


                <p>In 2016, we made a concerted effort to reach out to potential project presenters from regions outside of Northern America and Europe. We found that the increase in geographic representation on stage strengthened the program by showcasing projects and initiatives across a wider range of geographical and cultural contexts.</p>

                <p>With all this in mind, we recognize that we still have significant room for improvement in this domain. Since 2014, we have asked for established speakers to cover their own cost of attendance (which nearly all have done) in order to allocate as much funding as possible toward travel scholarships. However, this has contributed to a significant overrepresentation of Northern American and European speakers in OpenCon’s panels and keynotes. We are committed to continuing to improve the regional diversity of speakers at OpenCon in future years by continuing to draw speakers from our global scholarship participant pool and providing travel funding to speakers where necessary.</p>

                <h2>Communicating Venue Accessibility</h2>
                <p>Explicit information about building accessibility should be made available to attendees before they arrive to the conference. While we have not done this in past conference years, in the future, we will provide detailed information on both the webpage and pre-conference communications about the accessibility of the venue (e.g. is it wheelchair accessible? Are there accessible bathrooms/toilets in the venue building? If there are stairs, how many are there?)<br></br>
                </p>


                <h2>Venue Sound System</h2>
                <p>Make sure that your conference venue is equipped with a microphone sound system so that all participants can hear what the speakers are saying. If possible, choose a venue that can accommodate wireless microphones for use during audience Q&A.<br></br> </p>

                <h2>Gender Neutral Bathrooms</h2>
                <p>Make sure that gender neutral bathrooms are easily accessible in the building(s) where the conference is being held. Gender neutral bathrooms are bathrooms that anyone can use, regardless of gender identity. Unlike male/female bathrooms, which exclude transgender people and those who identify outside the gender binary, gender neutral bathrooms are inclusive of all gender identities.<br></br></p>


                <h2>Prayer Room</h2>
                <p>Some faiths require prayer at different points of the day. To accommodate this, it’s important to make a quiet room available for those who need to pray to do so. We tell participants in advance that this room will be available in conference communications.</p>

                <h2>Quiet Room</h2>
                <p>Ensure that a room is also made available where anyone who needs a quiet space away from the main conference can retreat.</p>

                <h2>Maternity Room</h2>
                <p>Some conference attendees may be nursing mothers. Participants should be told in advance that a room will be made available where mothers could nurse or pump in private, if desired. Also be sure to specify whether a power outlet is available.</p>
